RecordSelect
============

(c) 2007 - 2016 Sergio Cambra, Lance Ivy

RecordSelect is a Rails widget to help you pick one record out of many. I designed it as a more usable and performant alternative to generating a massive dropdown list. It relies on AJAX, powered by jQuery, so jQuery must be loaded first, either from jquery-rails gem or just loading the JS in the assets pipeline, or imported before importing record_select if using importmap.

Please see the ActionView::Helpers::RecordSelectHelpers for the most common API. More documentation (and HOWTOs) can be found online at the wiki.

= USAGE WITH ASSETS PIPELINE

Add to application.js

```js
//= require jquery
//= require record_select
```

= USAGE WITH IMPORTMAP

Add to importmap.rb

```rb
pin "jquery"
pin "record_select"
```

Add to app/assets/config/manifest.js

```js
//= link jquery.js
//= link record_select.js
```

Add to app/javascript/application.js

```js
import 'jquery'
import 'record_select'
```

= USAGE WITH ACTIVE_SCAFFOLD

Either using assets pipeline or importmap, it will be loaded when requiring or importing active_scaffold, so no need to add it to application.js, importmap.rb or manifest.js

= DEPENDENCIES
This depends on the excellent Paginator gem by Bruce Williams. This simple gem is available at paginator.rubyforge.org.

It should autoselect js framework, but you can select :jquery or :prototype framework with config/initializer file:
RecordSelect::Config.js_framework = :jquery
RecordSelect::Config.js_framework = :prototype
